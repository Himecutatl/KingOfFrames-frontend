# KingOfFrames

### Your project idea 
King of Frames is an app providing a convenient platform to reference characters' frame data from the King of Fighters series of video games, specifically King of Fighters XIII and XV. The importance of understanding frame data in competitive fighting games is proportional to how comprehension of Javascript is crucial for being a proficient web developer. The app will provide the raw numbers and images of each move, make note of any special properties (e.g. Invulnerability, Unblockable), and a comment functionality for users to make personal notes of any given set of data (ex: "This move punishable by my uppercut with a 4 frame leniency). 

### Your tech stack (frontend, backend, database)
Front: React
Back: Django
DB: PostgreSQL

### User stories
-As a user I want to be able to view frame data on separate pages for each character.
-As a user who is newer to competitive fighting games, I want a page explaining numpad notation, which is used to articulate the commands/input for each move.
-As a user I want to be able to see what the move looks like.
-As a user I want to be able to browse between the KOF titles for different sets of frame data.
-As a user I want to leave notes under specific moves.
-As a user, when viewing the frame data page I want to scroll left on the data table to easily view the entirety of it without compression for readability. 

## Stretch Goals
-As a user I'd like there to be samples for combos written out in numpad notation.
-As a user I'd like to see images of the hitboxes of each move.
-As a user I'd like to be able to directly compare one move's data with another to determine if the opposing attack is punishable by the latter.
-As a user I'd like to reference frame data for all the currently competitive KOF titles (XV, XIII, XI, 2k2UM, 98FE.
